üìçThe essence of the game:
Both players initially have 2 billion tenge.
When passing the circle, the balance is replenished by 500k tenge.
First, a die is thrown and it is determined who goes first. If a player gets to a place, he can buy it or not buy it. After the second player goes, if he gets on someone else's property that has already been bought, then he must pay a fee. Also, if a player collects all assets with the same color, then he is given a reward in the form of money.
If the balance is equal to or below 0, then the player loses.
